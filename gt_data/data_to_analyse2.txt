This time Luca couldn't really keep the shiver to himself when Jack leaned in, simply because he had only expected him to get more comfortable.
Luca breathed in sharply, grimacing slightly before he got himself back under control.
Luca's hand went to Jack's forearm regardless, pushing him away from his wasist.
He thought better of it by the time he'd already finished the movement but the momentary relief of not being so caged in made it almost worth it.
Luca's neck flexed to keep from pulling away entirely, but he didn't try particularily hard to hide his distaste either.
His arm flexed as it kept Jack's hand at a distance, fingers wrapped around his forearm.
He didn't look away from the TV, still not seeing a thing.
Jack really wished he could have seen his face when he pulled away, seen the way he couldn't hide his discomfort from him.
There was something to attractive about Luca hating this, it only made the instances where he didn't that much better.
"Talk to me", Jack demanded, "Tell me something."
