It was amazing how Raihan had the power to put him in a better mood like this, when usually Hop was the one doing that, but after their fight that morning, he had done nothing but stew in his bad mood all day, avoiding Hop to leave him in peace, and go about his own business. 
The image of Hop smiling at him was stuck in his brain on repeat, and he only showed Raihan to the door, giving him a wave goodbye, closing and locking the door behind him before he finally snapped out of it. 
Now Hop was glaring up at him, and Leon took only a moment to point a finger right at his face. 
Leon's knees bucked when the pain made him cry out, and he released Hop as he almost toppled over, who wasted not one second before pushing away from him, turning on his heels, and sprinting across the room. 
All he did was shift Hop on top of his shoulder, making sure he wouldn't drop him as he kicked and pulled away, before Leon carried him off down the hallway. 
His tears pooled down his cheeks, falling in constant streams and he sniffled. 
His gaze was cast downward, eyes lidded with fresh tear streaks stained against his cheek. 
He hadn't moved the entire time, only sat on his bed, breathing heavy, but slow. 
All he did was breathe and continue to cry quietly. 
But there he was, scowling at her through the glass and slamming his palms on the door, shouting inaudibly at her. 
He'd been shot dead in the torso, and yet here he was, still with the energy to shout at her though she could hardly hear him. 
"Come on, then!" 
There weren't many moments when she wasn't hovering just over his shoulder, waiting for him to tell her what to do or what to say. 
The hope of finding their son was dwindling further and further every second they remained in this desolate wasteland, but with Nate looking at her like that, she didn't dare say anything else. 
He never asked why. 
Now he knew better. 
To him! 
He stood inside the doorway, brows pulled down in a judgmental frown, and Hunter couldn't help but feel he had failed some unspoken test for him as well as Belos. 
Or were they more opportunists like the Coven Heads and castle workforce?
