Now it was Leon's turn to lean against the doorframe as he eyed his friend. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
"So, what'd you need? {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
I'm sure you didn't come by just to say hi?" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
Another shrug. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
"Something like that." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
Raihan fished around in the front pocket of his hoodie before producing a wad of money. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
"Uh, I know it's late, but I wanted to pay you back. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
Literally." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
Leon stared at the money in his friend's hands. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
"Not that I don't appreciate it, but what for?" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
Yet another shrug. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
"Always making you pay for food and stuff. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
I know we joke around about it, but it's been kinda eating at me too. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
And also..." He trailed off then, looking away from Leon before biting his lower lip. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
"Wanted to apologize for last weekend." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
Leon's throat tightened, a cold sweat pricking at his back, and he narrowed his mouth before trying his hardest to appear unfazed by that. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
"Wh-what?" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
Okay, that wasn't being unfazed at all. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
"Look, champ, I know we joke a lot and I know we fool around and stuff, but I don't want you to think I'd try stealing Hop away or anything. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
Whatever is going on between the two of you, it's none of my business. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
I know I said some stuff when I was hammered, but you know I get stupid when I've had one too many." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
Raihan rolled his head back before letting out a loud sigh. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
"Point being, sorry for saying those things." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
"It's..." Fine? {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
That's what Leon was supposed to say, but he was a little surprised to hear his friend unload these apologies onto him like this. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
"Don't worry about it. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
Keep your money. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
I know I give you a hard time, but I don't mind buying you a meal every once in awhile." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
Letting out a sigh through his nose, Raihan pocketed the money before leaning back to pop his shoulders and back. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
"Your loss, champ. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
Guess I'm obligated to treat you next time." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
"I'll hold you to it. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
And make sure I pick the most expensive meal on the menu." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
"You're mean." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
Leon couldn't help but burst out a small laugh at that. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
It was amazing how Raihan had the power to put him in a better mood like this, when usually Hop was the one doing that, but after their fight that morning, he had done nothing but stew in his bad mood all day, avoiding Hop to leave him in peace, and go about his own business. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: n}
It weighed on his mind to think how in denial Hop was about all this, but he wasn't going to give up on him. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
They may have had their spats, and Leon hated getting into arguments with him, but it was inevitable for everything to always be one hundred percent happy and fine all the time. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Still, there were times he wished Hop would try, just try a little bit harder. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
From his end, all he got were sarcastic responses and denial, but Leon knew deep down maybe he was just ashamed of his true feelings. {physical_violence:n  psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
He wanted to think, at least he hoped to think, that Hop was just as in love with him as he was, but he was too embarrassed to admit it. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
"Raihan?" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
The sound of the small voice from up the hall made Leon start, and he was snapped from his thoughts, both he and Raihan whipping their heads up and around to see Hop standing in the hallway, peeking around the corner at them. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
Leon opened his mouth to call to him, but Raihan beat him to it. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
"Hop! {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
How ya feeling?" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
Hop nodded, and Leon felt his blood boil as he stood there and watched him smile at Raihan. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
It was one of those small, shy smiles, but it was a fucking smile all the same, and he gritted his teeth. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
There was no way he hadn't done that on purpose. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
No way. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
"Better." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
"That's good! {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
Champ been taking good care of you?" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
Hop shrugged, not bothering to even give Leon the decency of looking over at him while they talked about him. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
"I guess." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
"You guess?" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
Hop shrugged again, but Raihan turned around then to give Leon a clap on the back, a clap so forceful he didn't expect it and toppled forward over his feet before catching himself to right back up. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
"Well, I'm sure he's doing his best, right?" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
Leon nodded, still in shock over the fact Hop smiled at Raihan like that, and his brain was refusing to function long enough to think of a coherent sentence. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
"Y-yeah..."

"Alright, I'd better hit the road then. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
Just wanted to drop by for a second." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
Again, Raihan gave Leon a clap on the shoulder, a much softer, friendly clap, one that didn't make Leon almost trip, before giving Hop a wave as well. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
"Talk to you you later, champ." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
Leon tried to come back to life enough to converse with him, he really did, but he just couldn't. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
The image of Hop smiling at him was stuck in his brain on repeat, and he only showed Raihan to the door, giving him a wave goodbye, closing and locking the door behind him before he finally snapped out of it. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: n}
Whipping his head around to Hop, he spotted him crossing the kitchen and rummaging around in the sweets cabinet before he was on him, striding across to close the distance between them before he was right behind him, Hop not acknowledging him before he grabbed a bag of cookies out of the pantry. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
"Just what the hell was that all about, huh?" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
"What, I'm hungry." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
All Leon was given from Hop was a small, barely even considered a glance before he was digging into the cookies to snack. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
"You know damn well what I mean, Hop." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
And Leon hadn't meant to, but he reached out, snatching the bag away from Hop who let out a ‘hey!' {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
before placing it on the counter next to him, never once breaking his gaze away from him. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
"What's your problem?!" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Now Hop was glaring up at him, and Leon took only a moment to point a finger right at his face. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: n}
"That. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
Right there. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
You didn't bother coming out of your room all day until Raihan showed up. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
So, which is it, Hop? {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
You like him, don't you?" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Heat rushed to Hop's face and Leon watched his cheeks grow red, his eyebrows furrowing as he backed against the pantry door. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
"No! {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
I already told you, you fucking psycho! {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
He's your friend." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
"So why did you smile at him?" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
"I didn't smile a-"

"Yes, you did, I stood right over there and watched you!" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
At that, Hop pushed past him, huffing as he no doubt planned to head back to his room, but Leon caught his arm, pulling him back. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
"I'm not done talking to you, Hop!" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
"Let go of me! {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
You're fucking insane and I'm not going to stand here and argue with you over who I'm allowed to smile at!" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
When Hop made to pull away from him again, Leon reached back over to grip him by his t-shirt, pulling him back until he had him gripped by both arms this time. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Even still, Hop thrashed back and forth, pushing at him, but to no avail. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
Leon was stronger, and Hop knew that, even throughout his struggles, he knew he didn't have the strength to pull away from Leon, but he was fighting him anyway. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
"You know." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Leon's grip tightened, and he didn't care if he was digging his nails into Hop's arms, close to scratching his skin. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
He didn't fucking care right now. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
And if it had been any other time, he would have vomited at the thought of saying something like this to Hop, but he was too angry right now, too fed up with his fucking attitude he'd been forced to deal with all week long, too fed up with trying to be patient with him. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
If Hop wanted to fight so bad, then Leon would oblige him all he wanted. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
"You know he likes you." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Hop froze, Leon feeling it when he seized up in his hold, his eyes widening before he broke his gaze away, cheeks gushing red. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
"No, he doesn't." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
"Yeah, I keep forgetting you know everything, Hop." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
He rolled his eyes, gripping him harder and gaining a small wince from him when he dug his nails into him. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: n}
"But, that night he was here drinking, he told me. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
He told me he wanted to fuck you." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
It wasn't a lie to leave out the part he also wanted Leon in on the fun, but he didn't feel the need to include that. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
It sickened him to be saying things like this to Hop, but his rationale was shot, and he knew deep down he was only saying things like this to scare him. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
But, he didn't care. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Let Hop be scared. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Let him think everything Leon did was horrible and that life was just so bad for him right now. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Let him think that all he wanted. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
But, the reaction was immediate. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Hop froze, seeming not to have noticed Leon was hurting his arms, but he stared up at him in absolute horror. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
"I-I don't believe you." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
"You never do. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
You didn't believe me about your little girlfriend and you didn't believe me about your Mum either." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
These were horrible things to say, Leon knew that, but he didn't care. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
Let these words hurt Hop as bad as he was hurting him. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
Let him get scared. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
He deserved it. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
"And look what happened with them, Hop. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Mum kicked you out, your dumb little girlfriend rejected you. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Now you won't believe me when I tell you Raihan wants to fuck you? {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
And you still have the nerve to smile at him like you do?" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
He smirked, enjoying way too much how Hop's expression only continued to fall, until he wasn't moving at all, but frozen in shock. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
"If you lead him on like that, he might try something with you. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
You'd better be careful about getting friendly with him, Hop. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
If you think-no-if you wanna lie and say that life with me is awful when we both know you love it, imagine if Raihan gets his hands on you." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
Hop sucked in a breath through his teeth, and Leon could see it on his expression. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
He was terrified, and Leon fucking loved that he was. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
"He won't hold back like I do. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
He'd keep going until you're bleeding, crying, begging him to leave you alone. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
He's into way freakier shit than you can imagine. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
He might tie you up, gag you, drug you. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
Hell, it's all on the table when it comes to him. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
But oh, you just keep smiling at him like that, let him think you're into it, and he won't hold back on you. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
Unless, of course, you really are into all that, and you want him-"

"No!" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
Hop's voice was riddled with hysteria, and Leon could hear him cracking as he struggled to say what he had to say. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
"I-I don't want any of that! {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Dammit, Lee, let go of me!" {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
He frowned. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
"Then why are you flirting with him?" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
He blatantly ignored his request. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
"You're insane! {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
What part of smiling at someone has anything to do with flirting with them?!" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Hop pulled at him again, but Leon only dug his nails into his arms yet again, causing Hop to yelp when he pressed him too hard. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
"Why don't you tell me? {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
I'd love to hear your excuse, or rather, your lies." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
"Lee." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
Hop grew strangely lax then, all of his struggles strangely quiet, even his voice, which had been escalating the entire time, grew low, and he lowered his head before speaking to Leon. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
"I don't like Raihan like that. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
I don't even know him! {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
I don't like you like this either! {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
It's fucking creepy that you want to touch me the way you do!" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Creepy? {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
"I'm not getting into this argument with you again, Hop. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
I've already told you my thoughts on that, and the sooner you realize-"

But, Leon never even got to finish that sentence. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
With his hands wrapped around Hop's arms, him having grown lax, he'd inadvertently let his guard down, but it was all the time Hop needed to rear his leg up before he kicked him square in the crotch. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: n}
Leon's knees bucked when the pain made him cry out, and he released Hop as he almost toppled over, who wasted not one second before pushing away from him, turning on his heels, and sprinting across the room. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: n}
In a split second, Hop was at the front door, fumbling with the lock, but despite the pain Leon was in, despite his shaking knees and his hisses of swears through his teeth, he was on him in seconds, not giving him a chance to undo the lock before he wrapped his arms around him from behind, pulling him up off the floor and away from the front door. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: n}
Hop scrambled in his hold, thrashing, kicking, pushing at him until Leon had to struggle to keep his grip on him so he wouldn't drop him. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
The pain between his legs was dulling, though not fast enough for him to compose himself long enough to shift his grip on Hop and prop him in his arms properly. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: n}
"LET ME GO! {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
LEE, GET OFF ME!" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
His voice had climbed to a shrill screech, and it sent shivers down Leon's spine to hear him make such a noise of horror, but he didn't dare waver his grip on him, only continuing to hold him the way he was, hoping he would tucker himself out eventually and stop thrashing so much. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
"Where the hell do you think you're going?!" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
He tightened his arms, just enough that he could hear Hop gasp for breath when he squeezed his chest, but not enough to hurt him. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
Despite that, Hop continued thrashing, kicking, flailing around like a wild animal while Leon fought to keep him steady. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
It was getting harder and harder though. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
"I'M LEAVING! {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
LET GO!" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
"LIKE HELL YOU ARE!" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
Again, the pain in between his legs was aching, but Leon bit the blood from his lip to keep from giving in and dropping Hop. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
He knew if he did, he wouldn't hesitate to scramble away, yank open that door, and run like hell. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
He could not let that happen. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
He could not let Hop run away from him like this. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
"LEE!" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
Hop, in his attempts to get away, Hop was thrashing as though Leon were holding him underwater and he was drowning, but he could hear the way his voice was starting to crack, just the slightest bit of a crack, and the way he was fighting so hard against him, even the tiniest movements, Leon could feel were slacking. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
He was tiring himself out like this, but Leon held onto him. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
"HELP! {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
SOMEONE, HELP!" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
At that, Leon ignored the pain he was feeling entirely to reach up, one arm still wrapped around Hop, squeezing his chest when he did so, and slapped his palm over his mouth, muffling his words. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
"Shut up! {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Hop, nobody cares! {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Nobody is coming here, nobody cares what I do in my apartment, nobody is going to give two shits if you scream for help, so all you're doing is wearing yourself out!" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
But, that didn't stop Hop from reaching up with his free hands, gripping hold of Leon's wrist, and biting down as hard as he could onto his hand, causing Leon to fumble when he screeched in pain, blood dribbling down, and he dropped him. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: n}
Fresh blood oozed, Hop hadn't held back at all, but the moment he dropped him, Hop tripped, stumbling over his own feet. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: n}
He went to reach for the front door again, but Leon grabbed the back of his shirt, yanking him away back to his arms. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
"Hop, if you don't stop fighting me, I will lock you up in your room! {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
Don't think I won't!" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
"SHUT UP! {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
YOU'RE SICK, A FUCKING PSYCHO!" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
With his arms wrapped around him, Hop couldn't thrash as much as he wanted, but Leon could feel him trying to kick at him again, using every ounce of his strength to try and break out of his hold, but he wasn't going to let him do that. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
The moment he reared back as much as he could, jabbing Leon in the chest with his elbow, he purposefully dropped him. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Only this time, before Hop could scramble away from him again, Leon only gripped him by the arm, spinning him around to face him, before he pushed him as hard as he could against the wall. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Hop floundered to it, not able to recover before Leon was on him, pressing him against it with his body frame alone. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
"Hop, I'm not fucking playing around with you. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
You aren't leaving, and I'm not lying when I tell you that I will lock you up." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
"Then do it!" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
His voice was shot, Hop not looking up at him as he pushed against his chest, trying to get him off, but Leon didn't budge. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Even as Hop screamed at him, his voice breaking and cracking from still not being fully recovered from his sickness, but still, he pushed and thrashed, trying to get Leon off him. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
"You're a fucking psycho, Lee!" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
"Stop calling me that!" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
"You're insane! {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
You can't seriously stand there and tell me everything you're doing isn't creepy as fuck! {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
I hate it! {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
I hate it, Lee! {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
Let me go, I wanna go home! {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
I wanna go home and be with Gloria and Mum!" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
A final push, and Leon never budged as Hop struggled. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
"I WANT TO GO HOME!" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
Without responding, without even acknowledging what he was saying, Leon pulled away from him only long enough to scoop him up in one quick motion, and he tossed Hop over his shoulder like a rag doll. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
"PUT ME DOWN! {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
LEE, LET ME GO!" {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
All he did was shift Hop on top of his shoulder, making sure he wouldn't drop him as he kicked and pulled away, before Leon carried him off down the hallway. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: n}
"LEE!" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
He pushed and kicked, reaching around to pull at Leon's hair as he did so, but he never budged. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
He never flinched or made any movements that Hop was hurting him, because he didn't care anymore. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
Let him fight. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Let Hop deny this all he wanted. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Let him sit there and scream and throw a tantrum like this, try to run out on him. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Fucking let him say horrible things to Leon that broke his heart when he knew the truth, when he knew how Hop really felt. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
But. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
In seconds, he had carried Hop back to his room, and threw him on the mattress {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: n}
with more force than intended before he crawled over him, straddling him as Hop attempted to stand and run. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: n}
Leon didn't give him a chance to even think he was about to let him do that. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
Reaching over, he nabbed both of his wrists, and slammed them down onto the mattress near his head where Hop couldn't push at him. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
He pressed down on his legs with his own, knowing he would try to kick him, but he wasted no more time, gave no more patience or sympathy for him when he bent over and kissed him. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
It was only a moment he got to taste him like that, but the instant he kissed him, Hop opened his mouth. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
For a split moment, Leon thought he might actually kiss back, but the splitting pain on his bottom lip when Hop bit him became apparent soon enough. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
Leon reared back, yelping as blood dribbled down his chin, and he glared down at Hop who continued to struggle under him, though there wasn't much he could do with the way Leon had him held down. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
"You wanna fight me, Hop? {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
Go right ahead. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Go ahead and fight until you tire yourself out. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
Go ahead and deny to yourself that you loved every bit of what I did to you. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
Shout it to the world if you want, I don't care!" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
He leaned over, glaring down at Hop through lidded eyes, his nose mere inches away. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
"But, don't you fucking dare ever lie to me. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
You love this, and you know that you do." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
"I don't-"

Without even waiting for him to finish, Leon leaned down and pressed his mouth to his neck, earning a sharp gasp from Hop when he did so, when he could feel him try and pull away again to no avail. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
"Stop! {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Stop it!" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
With his free arm, Hop reached up, slapping him straight across the face, but Leon only flinched for a moment, not allowing Hop to move a single inch. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
"LEE! {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
GET OFF ME!" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
"Shut up." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Hop had the nerve to try and leave him, had the nerve to continue sitting here and lying to him about how much he hated this, when Leon knew damn well he loved it. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
He loved it, he loved this, and if Leon was going to have to prove that to him again and again, then so be it. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
"Lee!" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
Again, Hop reached up, throwing his fist into Leon's face, hitting him across the cheek in the same spot, but Leon didn't budge. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
He was too focused on holding him down to care about the pain in his body, and it didn't matter how much Hop hit him, kicked him, bit into his flesh, he wasn't going to budge. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
"You keep lying and saying you hate it, but I know the truth, Hop. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
And the truth is, you've always been enamored with me, right?" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
He laughed, mostly to himself. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
Hop was still struggling beneath him like he was, still hitting at his face, chest, anywhere he could land his slaps. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
Hop hit Leon everywhere he could reach, but he had stopped feeling the pain from that long ago. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: n}
"You probably laid awake thinking of me, didn't you?" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
"No! {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
I never did!" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
"Liar. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
You would always get so excited to see me when I came to town, like you couldn't contain yourself when I came to visit, like it was the happiest time of your life. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
So, of course, you were ashamed of your crush on me, the champion. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
You buried it deep down, deep, deep down where nobody would know how disgusting you really were, that all those times you recorded my matches was so you could imagine all the things you wanted me to do to you." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
"YOU'RE CRAZY!" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Hop was still struggling to pull his legs out from under him, but having no luck with Leon loving -absolutely loving the uncomfortable grunts that Hop made as he only thrashed back and forth, trying to throw the other man off him. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
"You hid it away from everyone, even convinced yourself that you liked your neighbor, all so you wouldn't have to face the reality that you were in love with me. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
But, I wouldn't have minded, Hop. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
All you had to do was come to me and ask." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
"I never felt that way about you! {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Lee, you're fucking crazy!" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Leon looked up, smirked at him as he continued holding his arm down to keep him flattened to the bed, even throughout Hop's struggles, he couldn't push him off, and they both knew that. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
They both knew Leon was stronger, and he was only proving it right now that Hop never had a chance against him from the beginning. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
"Now look at you. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
In too deep, rejected by your girlfriend because even she knew you were fucked up from the beginning, Hop. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
Even your mother knew." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
At the mention of his mom, Hop stopped struggling as much, only making uncomfortable whines that bubbled from the back of his throat as Leon could see the tears form in the corners of his eyes, falling just as soon. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
Hop cried, lying below him, his one free arm having reached up at some point to grab hold of Leon's shirt and he squeezed, his voice shaking when he finally spoke. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
"I never-Lee, I-I never wanted this." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
"Of course you did, Hop. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
You wanted me from the beginning, and you know it. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Stop lying to me." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
Leon could tell he was hurting him, but Hop had hurt him plenty enough. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
"I just wanted Gloria." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
Hop's tears fell, and his gaze shifted from Leon to the corner of the wall behind him, his lip quivering. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
"L-Lee, I wanted her to like me. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
I loved being with her." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
"She never liked you, Hop. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
If she did, she wouldn't have rejected you, now would she?" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Leon shifted one hand to keep Hop pinned down by his chest, enjoying the way Hop shuddered at the feeling of him, but he didn't fight again like Leon had thought he might. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
"Lee..." Leon watched little by little as the life drained from Hop, his tears falling in streams, his gaze never once leaving the wall. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
"You can't...y-you can't possibly think I wanted this with you. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
It was Gloria. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
I liked Gloria, Lee." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
"She didn't care enough about you. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Remember how upset you were that night in the tent? {physical_violence:n psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
She did that to you, Hop. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
She doesn't care about you at all." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
"And you do?" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Finally, Hop turned his gaze from the wall, slow at first, but stared up at Leon through lidded eyes, his expression hollow, his tears still running free, but nothing on his face gave Leon any indication of what he was really thinking. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
So, all he did was give him a smile. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
It wasn't as gentle as he wanted, but Leon couldn't bring himself to be generous to him right now. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
"Of course, I care about you, Hop. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
I love you." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Slowly, very slowly, Hop shook his head from side to side, the tears spilling, and his lip quivered when he let out a sob. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
Quiet at first, but it began to claw its way out until he was huffing, shifting his body below Leon in an effort he could feel was to remove himself away from Leon's body that he still had pressed against him. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
"I hate you. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
I hate you, Lee." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
His eyes opened, full of tears as they spilled down his face, down his temples and into his hair. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
There were so many tears, it was amazing how his voice was as composed as it was, even as he said these horrible things to him. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
"I-I hate you." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
"That's fine." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
Leon was shaking, his hand snapping up to Hop's throat, gaining a gargled choked sound from him when he did so. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: n}
Hop slammed his eyes shut, reaching up with his free arm to cover his eyes. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
"That's fine if you hate me, Hop. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
It's just another lie, but if you want to tell yourself that to make it all better for you, then go right ahead. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
I don't care." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
He said that, but-

Leon swallowed, slowly tightening his grip around Hop's throat until he yelped down below him, obviously in pain, but Leon didn't care. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
It hurt. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
It hurt to hear him say words like that to him, and he could feel it in his chest, the feeling like his heart was just broken in two. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
Hop didn't mean it. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Even if Leon told himself that, that Hop was just in denial, that he really did love him, he could say it all he wanted, he felt the weight of those words, and it dipped down until he felt like someone punched him in the gut. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
The slaps, the hair pulling, the biting so hard he drew Hop's blood, all of that was so minuscule to those three words. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
It hurt Leon in a way he never thought was possible, and he felt it when tears came to his own eyes, but he blinked them away just as fast. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
Hop didn't mean it. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
He didn't mean it. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
He didn't mean those things. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
He was just hysterical-he was just embarrassed to admit that he loved Leon like he did. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
He was just saying these things to cover up his own shame. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Right. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
"Stop covering your face." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Leon felt empty, Hop's words made him feel hollow, and he held no remorse when he reached over to pry Hop's arm off his face, revealing his eyes that were still slammed shut. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
"Hop, look at me." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Leon took his arm, folding it back down onto the bed so that he held onto both of his wrists in one hand, the other still at his neck. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
"Hop." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
Hop cringed under him, gritting his teeth as Leon held his neck tightly, but Leon didn't care. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
He felt so empty right now, he doubted he even had drive to put feeling into this anymore. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
He was just-

Numb. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
"Hop, look at me." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
Bending over, Leon kissed him, gaining another groaned sound from him, and he half-expected him to bite him again, but he didn't. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
Hop only blinked for a moment when more tears fell, as Leon inhaled the scent of him that mixed with the smell of his shampoo and sweat. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
When he leaned up, some of the blood from his lip had traversed to the corner of Hop's mouth, and he would've smiled at it, but he couldn't bring himself to feel anything other than overwhelming emptiness right now. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
All he did was relax his grip just the slightest bit, not enough to hurt him, but enough he knew it was still uncomfortable for Hop. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: n}
For Hop to lie here and say things like that to him-- To sit here and say he hated him, that he hated this, and refused to look up at him-- 

It didn't matter anymore. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
"For the last time-" Leon's voice, though empty, lowered into a growl, and he hadn't meant to sound this way, but it came out nonetheless. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
"Look at me, Hop." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
He reached up, releasing his wrist, not waiting for his reply when he gripped hold of Hop's chin to pull him up just enough that he wasn't flattened into the floor. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: n}
Hop's eyes snapped open then, a stream of tears falling down his cheek when Leon held him up, and he loosened his hold a bit. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
"That's better. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
You're going to look into my eyes when I talk to you. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
You're going to see how much you love this, and you'll see how I never once lied to you, Hop. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
Deny it all you want, but-" A particularly hard pull from Leon, one that made Hop grunt below him, but he continued. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
"You're going to see sooner or later I've been right all along. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
You'll see. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
I'll make you see. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
Even if I have to keep you here forever, you'll understand." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
Hop didn't reply, but blinked his tears away as Leon finally released his face, reaching back over, gripping hold of his hand instead of his wrist this time, and intertwining their fingers together. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
"You belong here, Hop. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
You belong with me. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
You and me, we were made for each other, we were meant to be together this whole time. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
Your girlfriend knew it, that's why she rejected you. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Your mother knew it, that's why she kicked you out. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
We were meant to be with each other like this. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
And you..." He leaned down to give him a chaste kiss to the mouth. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
"You were made to be here with me like this. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
You belong like this, Hop. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
Deny it all you want, but look at you. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
You even stopped fighting me. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
You hate it? {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
No fucking way you do." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Throughout his entire spill, Hop said nothing, his eyes lidded, no longer looking up at Leon, but he didn't have to. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
His tears pooled down his cheeks, falling in constant streams and he sniffled. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: n}
Even in this state, Leon let out a laugh through his nose, though it didn't hold as much joy as he would have liked. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
He just couldn't muster any joy to feel. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
The entire time he talked, Hop didn't say a word to him, but even with his head turned to the side, Leon could see the tears streaming down, hear his choked noises as he gasped. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
Deny it all he wanted, even throughout all his fighting, when push came to shove, Hop loved it here. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
He was just ashamed. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Just in denial. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
He didn't hate Leon, he knew that. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
It was a spur of the moment thing for him to say, but Hop didn't mean it. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
With a resounding sigh, Leon pulled his hand away from his neck, his body still shaking as he crawled off him, and Hop soon brought himself up with him, leaning into a half sitting position. {physical_violence: y, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: n}
His gaze was cast downward, eyes lidded with fresh tear streaks stained against his cheek. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: n}
"See this?" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
Leon wiped across his lip, held his blood-stained hand up for Hop to look at, but received no reaction from him. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
With Hop not looking at him, Leon instead reached forward and dragged his palm against Hop's cheek, smearing his blood against him and causing Hop to grimace, but not react any further. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
"You did this. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
That's your mess, Hop. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
Deny it all you want, but this was nobody's fault but yours." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
With that, Leon stood off the bed and gave Hop a quick glance. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
He hadn't moved the entire time, only sat on his bed, breathing heavy, but slow. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: n}
He never once reached up to so much as wipe away the blood against his cheek, but Leon could still see tears falling down his face, blurring the scarlet. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
Hop never looked up at him. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
"I warned you, Hop. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
I think you need some alone time, what do you think?" {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
No response, not that he expected one, but Leon continued. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
"You're not leaving the apartment. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
Not unless I say so. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
Cry all you want, scream all you want, nobody is going to question me if I tell them otherwise. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
You may as well get used to it, because this is your home now." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
He gave Hop a final hard pressed stare, wishing he would look up at him, but Hop made no attempts whatsoever to even acknowledge him in that moment. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
All he did was breathe and continue to cry quietly. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: n}
"If you make any moves while I'm working on your door, any attempts to run away, I'll do worse than install a bolt on your door next time. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
I'm not lying to you, Hop. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
I never lied before, but you pushed me to do this. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
This is your fault." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
He had never wanted to do this to him, but Hop just continued to push. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
He just couldn't trust him anymore, not after all this. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
Not after the way he fought him, bit into him, and tried to run like he had. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
Leon had no choice. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: y}
"I'll check on you later." {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: n, emotional_violence: n}
With that, he slammed Hop's door shut, rattling the frame when he did so before going to fetch his tools. {physical_violence: n, psychological_violence: y, emotional_violence: y}
Carmina fell to the cold ground with a deep, desperate gasp for air. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Her lungs practically burned with her first real breath of fresh air in so long. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Her entire body shivered all over, a result of the pod she'd been trapped in. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
She was so cold, and her limbs were so stiff, but somehow - somehow - she found it in her to move her body. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
She propped one leg up and grabbed ahold of the pod behind herself, using it as leverage as she hauled herself up. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
When she was finally on her feet, she settled her eyes on something across from her. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Another pod with something - no, someone - inside. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Her heart missed a beat as her eyes locked with someone else's. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Nate, her husband. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He was alive. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Her brain felt so fried after spending God-knows how long in the pod, but all of a sudden she was hit with a memory. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Someone with a scar taking - kidnapping Shaun, her baby. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
And then - Jesus, and shooting Nate. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
But there he was, scowling at her through the glass and slamming his palms on the door, shouting inaudibly at her. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: y,}
How had he survived? {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He'd been shot dead in the torso, and yet here he was, still with the energy to shout at her though she could hardly hear him. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: y,}
Carmina took an unsteady step forward, a little closer to his pod, then stopped. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Nate did, too. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He watched her with stern eyes, almost like a warning. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
No, Carmina knew it was a warning. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
He was telling her to release him. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
To let him out of the currently inescapable pod and save him. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
But Carmina didn't know if she wanted to. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
She could leave him there to die - to starve and crumble - for everything he'd put her through over the years. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
But on the other hand, she loved him. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
She loved him so much and she couldn't just leave him there. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
That would be cruel. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
That would be her stooping to his level because she knew damn well that he'd do the same to her if their roles were reversed. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: y,}
She couldn't just leave him there. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
She couldn't. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
She loved him so much and their son had been kidnapped, and she needed him. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
On shaky legs, she stumbled the rest of the way forward, saw the minor flicker of relief in Nate's eyes, and pressed the release button on his pod. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The door released with a hiss of smoke and opened up to set her husband free. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Nate stepped out of the pod on much sturdier legs than she had, falling to the floor and all, but she still instinctively held out her hands to help him just in case, anyway. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He batted them away, using his other hand to cover the bullet wound in his side. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
It wasn't bleeding now, somehow, but Carmina knew it would need medical attention anyway. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Once they'd gotten him the medical attention he needed, they would go to the police about Shaun and get him found. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Get him back safely in their arms. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"You hesitated," Nate breathed, his voice low and raspy. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
Possibly from being in the pod for so long. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"I didn't," Carmina denied the obvious fact. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
She'd stopped right in front of him and hesitated for a second. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Don't fucking lie to me, Mina," Nate grabbed her upper arm and pulled her in close so they were nose-to-nose. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: y,}
Carmina felt his breath on her lips, the bruising grip on her arm, and saw the anger in his eyes. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: y,}
The scarcely hidden betrayal. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
But then it all vanished very quickly, as it usually did when Nate had too much other shit on his mind to be angry at her, and he let go of her just as roughly as he'd grabbed her. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He began to stalk off, heading back the way they'd entered the vault and Carmina hesitated a little behind him. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Come on, then!" {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: y,}
Nate shouted back at her. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Carmina sighed quietly and hurried to follow him, falling easily into step just over his shoulder as she was prone to do. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
There weren't many moments when she wasn't hovering just over his shoulder, waiting for him to tell her what to do or what to say. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: y,}
Lately, especially since having Shaun, Nate had become even more demanding of her. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
She hardly felt like her own person anymore. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
If Nate didn't tell her what to do, or say, or wear, or eat, or drink, she didn't know what to do with herself. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
He controlled her life, just like she knew he would control Shaun's when their boy was old enough to listen to his commands. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
Carmina only hoped she could protect him from his father, the way she couldn't protect herself anymore. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
"Jesus, what the fuck happened to this place?" {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Nate muttered. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Carmina remained quiet because she knew he wasn't strictly speaking to her. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He was talking to himself, so he didn't want a response. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Did they shut down the pods?" {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Nate peered in through the glass of one of the other pods, one Carmina had last seen a neighbour stepping into. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
She recalled the guy with the scar and the gun - the man who'd shot Nate - and knew that her neighbours' fates had been caused by him and his ally in the lab suit, whoever she was. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Must've done," Nate continued to himself, then turned to her. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Let's get outta this fucking hole and find Shaun." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Carmina nodded and followed his lead again. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
They walked through the large Vault, taking in its barren state and picking up goods Nate decided he wanted such as a carton of cigarettes. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
It was only when they rounded a corner and came across what Carmina belatedly realised were giant cockroaches that she realised, aside from their son being kidnapped and Nate getting shot, something was seriously, definitely wrong. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Of course, there had been a nuclear bomb and there might not be strictly much to go back to when they left the Vault, but giant roaches? {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
What was going on? {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
After Nate killed the giant cockroaches and then some more a bit further on, they found a 10mm pistol near the entrance to the Vault alongside some ammo. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Nate, with his military background, took the gun and ammo and checked the pistol was loaded. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Once he was satisfied, they continued onwards towards the Vault entrance with Nate taking out any of the strange, giant cockroaches on the way. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
When they got to the entrance, Nate killed two more cockroaches before they both approached the control panel to open the Vault door. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
They examined it and then realised they would need a PipBoy to open it. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
To their luck (or dismay) there happened to be a skeleton nearby still wearing a PipBoy. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Carmina shook her head sadly at the poor Vault dweller who'd met their end in the Vault, potentially to the people who'd taken Shaun and shot Nate, but Nate merely reached down and took the device from the skeleton, removing its hand in the process. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
It clattered loudly to the floor, all the while Nate merely wrapped the PipBoy around his wrist and tightened it. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Carmina watched over his shoulder as he wiped some dust off of the screen and turned it on via a button to the side. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Then, he withdrew a wire and connected it to a port on the control panel. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The thick plastic covering the red Vault door button lifted up and Nate nodded at Carmina with a small smile. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Mirroring his expression, she reached forward and slammed her fist on the big, red button. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Immediately, the Vault whirred to life and the massive cog door began to turn. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The couple watched it with relief and anxiety at the world that would await them outside. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Nate took Carmina's hand and she wrapped her free palm around his bicep. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
They walked together onto the platform leading to the exit and waited patiently for it to take them to the stairs. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Once they were there, they descended the stairs together and then stepped onto the elevator. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Nate looked over at Carmina and she looked back up at him. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He linked their fingers and Carmina smiled softly at him. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The gate closed and the elevator began to rise. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Oh, my God," Carmina croaked once the light was no longer blinding her and she could see the destruction that had befallen her world. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Tears sprang to her eyes as she gazed across the barren wasteland that she'd once called home. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Sanctuary sat at the bottom of the hill, but no longer was it bright and colourful, and dream-like. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
No, now it was hazy, dead, and damn near unrecognisable. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Jesus, fuck," Nate followed Carmina with his own exclamation, running a hand through his black hair. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"The bomb did all this," Carmina pointed out. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"That's what bombs do," Nate replied unhappily. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Especially when the wrong people are in control of them." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"How will the world come back from this, though?" {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Carmina wondered with a lump in her throat. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Leaving the Vault now seemed almost hopeless. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Looking around at the sheer nothingness their world had been reduced to, they might've had a better chance of surviving in the Vault. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
But everyone in there was dead, and there were no resources left in there. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
No food or water, or anywhere to sleep. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
They had to go back to Sanctuary and see if they could find anyone there. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Carmina looked up to Nate for an answer or a decision. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Come on," he said, instead. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
On their way down the hill back to Sanctuary, they stopped quickly to check the area surrounding the Vault for any more weapons on the chance that they came across any cockroaches again, or anything else of the like. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
They only found a pipe, which Nate handed to Carmina, telling her to put her back into it if she needed to use it. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Carmina nodded, keeping the pipe tightly in her fist just in case anything jumped out at them. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Before the bomb had dropped, she'd been a lawyer whereas Nate had been in the military, so there was a stark contrast to the experience both of them had. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Nate knew how to use a weapon and how to survive, whereas Carmina only knew people. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
She wasn't equipped to deal with this. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
She was just lucky that Nate had survived with her. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
When they arrived back at Sanctuary, they were both lucky to have not come across any other giant insects or anything else that wanted to kill them. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Taking the first step back into the place they once called home - or what was left of it - felt like a nightmare Carmina couldn't wake up from. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The houses were all destroyed or on their way there. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The formerly green grass was brown and dead, and the once brightly coloured houses were now dull and lifeless. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The entirety of Sanctuary was lifeless. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
They very quickly realised, just by looking around, that there was no one about. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Except for one person. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Or, one robot. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"As I live and breathe…" Carmina heard. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
She stopped her examination of Sanctuary and turned around just in time for a very familiar Mr Handy to float closer. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Mum, Sir," Codsworth greeted. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: }
Carmina gave a watery smile and took a step closer, passing Nate who stood stock still. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Codsworth," Carmina sighed with relief. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"You're still here." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Codsworth had always been someone Carmina felt safe talking to, even in the presence of Nate. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
Her husband didn't seem to mind (or at least care) when she talked to the robot. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Maybe some small part of him understood that, having almost completely isolated her from both her friends and family, their Mr Handy was the only other being she had to talk to other than himself. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
"Well of course I'm still here," Codsworth exclaimed, "you don't think a little radiation could deter the pride of General Atomics International?" {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Carmina smiled a little, relieved to see and hear Codsworth again. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
She didn't think after leaving him to escape to the Vault that she would ever see him again, but here he was, seemingly none the worse for wear aside from a bit of rust and a few dents. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"And where is young Shaun, by the way? {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
I'm so happy to see both of you, but the boy?" {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Codsworth asked, gesturing with one of his many metallic limbs. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Suddenly, Carmina's smile dropped as the reminder of her son caused her heart to clench. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
She looked down and blinked away tears as Nate took control of the conversation. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Gone," he said, "some assholes kidnapped him and shot me. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
We need to find him." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Sir," Codsworth drooped, "these awful things you're saying. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
This seems likely to be delusions caused by blood loss! {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Not to worry, I'm sure I have a Stimpak and some bandages lying around somewhere." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"This isn't a delusion, you stupid robot!" {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Nate snapped. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"They took our goddamn baby, and we're gonna get him back! {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Now fetch me the Stimpak and bandages, and point us in the direction of the nearest surviving civilisation. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Now." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Codsworth was silent for a few moments, Carmina almost wondered if what Nate had said had finally broken the surviving robot. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
But then he turned and began to move. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He whizzed around and entered the house they'd been standing next to, which Carmina quickly realised was what remained of their home. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
She and Nate followed the Mr Handy inside, only to pause on the threshold at the state of the house. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
It was a mess. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Hardly anything remained of their furniture and anything that had somewhat survived was burned, torn, broken, or a combination of all three. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"There's Concord," Codsworth said while moving around the house, seemingly searching for the Stimpak and bandages. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Plenty of people there, and, last I checked, they only pummelled me with sticks a few times before I had to run back home." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"I like these people already," Nate mumbled as he leaned against the kitchen counter and checked the pistol he'd taken from the Vault. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Oh good! {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Maybe you'll get along, then, and they can help you find young Shaun," Codsworth said, apparently missing the sarcasm. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
From behind the kitchen counter, Codsworth swooped down and picked up some items. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Carmina recognised the Stimpak and bandages. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Nate nodded to Carmina and she dutifully headed to take the medical items from Codsworth. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The Stimpak was larger than she remembered (having not used one for at least a few months - or however long it had been since the bomb), but she recalled how to use it. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence:  psychological_violence: n,}
Once Nate had lifted his shirt, Carmina injected the Stimpak into his side near the bullet wound, and pressed down to release the liquid. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Nate barely winced. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Though Carmina was under the impression that Nate had wanted her to bandage the wound too, he took the roll from her and stalked over to sit on the dirty couch. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"I gotta get this bullet out," he muttered to her questioning gaze. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Make yourself useful while you wait. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Tidy this place up or something." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Carmina looked around her at the mess that was their bomb-stricken home and sighed quietly. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
It would be impossible to tidy the place up and get it looking brand new again, but she could probably just pick a few items up while she waited. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Turning away from her husband, Carmina began to kick aside bits of debris and dust, occasionally picking up items and putting them to the side just to make the place look a little tidier. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
She kept an eye on Nate as she did so, watching as he shucked the top half of his Vault suit off to access the bullet wound. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
She silently admired his toned abs from afar, the way his muscles flexed as he messily removed the bullet from his flesh. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
And then the clanking of metal on wood drew her back to reality when he tossed the abstracted bullet on the table in front of him. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Carmina winced at the sight of blood staining the bullet and the coffee table. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
By the time Nate had tightly wrapped the bandage around his torso, stemming the bleeding, for now, Carmina had somewhat tidied the kitchenette area to look almost presentable. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Nate pulled his Vault suit back up, hiding the bandages, and retrieved his gun from the coffee table. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"That should be enough for now," he said, seemingly biting back a wince. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Carmina placed a rusted, dented pot back on what had once been a functioning hob, and headed back to his side. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Does it hurt?" {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
She asked with concern. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Of course, it fucking hurts," Nate snapped, "I got shot, Carmina. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: n,}
Jesus." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Sorry," Carmina apologised. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: n,}
Nate shook his head and looked to Codsworth who was watching them. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"So, Concord?" {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He asked the Mr Handy. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Correct, sir," Codsworth answered. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"And beyond that, if you're unable to find any help there, you should be able to make your way to Diamond City. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
There's bound to be someone who can help you there." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Diamond City?" {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Carmina questioned. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"I believe it used to be called Fenway Park," Codsworth revealed. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Though, it's been a long time since then, of course. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
I could be getting my details mixed up." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"You're telling me Fenway Park is now a, what, a city?" {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Nate asked. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"As far as I've heard, yes," Codsworth confirmed. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Jesus, how long were we in that Vault?" {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Carmina breathed, running a hand through her hair. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Well, it's been a little over 200 years since the bombs originally fell, give or take," Codsworth said. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"200 years?" {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Carmina repeated. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Fuck," Nate said. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"It - we can't have been in there for 200 years," Carmina shook her head, "it's not possible. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
What about Shaun? {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
What if -"

"Don't," Nate stopped her abruptly with a rough hand on her arm. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"He's not dead. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
My son is out there somewhere and I'm going to find him, alive." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Carmina swallowed and nodded, but the tears remained in her eyes. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Her vision of Nate became blurry. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The hope of finding their son was dwindling further and further every second they remained in this desolate wasteland, but with Nate looking at her like that, she didn't dare say anything else. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: y,}
With a huff, Nate let go of her arm and barged around her. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He stormed towards the door and left the house. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Carmina remained rooted to the spot, unsure if he wanted her to follow her or not, until she heard:

"Carmina! {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Get your ass out here, now!" {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Jumping on the spot, Carmina bade Codsworth a hasty goodbye, and then followed Nate outside. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Look, if we're gonna find Shaun in this fucking wasteland, I can't have you dawdling," Nate said as soon as Carmina reached his side, "I had enough of it before the bombs fell, I definitely don't need it now. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Got it?" {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Carmina nodded. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"I'm sorry," she apologised. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Let's go before the sun sets," Nate said. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Concord is about twenty minutes from here, but Fenway Park has gotta be two or three hours. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The sun already looks low enough as it is." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Again, Carmina nodded. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
With a sigh, Nate check his gun and the ammo he'd managed to find in Vault 111. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Once he was satisfied, he bared his shoulders. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"All right, let's go," he said. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Nate began to walk off, heading towards the bridge leading out of Sanctuary. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Carmina quickly began to follow him and, deciding to try her luck, she took hold of his hand and linked their fingers. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
To her surprise, he didn't pull away or scold her. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Instead, he tightened his hold and pulled her a little closer to himself. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Carmina smiled and allowed him to lead the way. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Hunter did not have much use for birthdays so he tended to measure years in injuries and others' guesses about his age. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He knew what birthdays were, he just also knew his uncle disapproved of him slacking off and the desire to please his only family was so great that rejecting some arbitrary day of the year seemed a reasonable price. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: n,}
Bruised cheekbone and a slight concussion from a punch he wasn't fast enough to dodge in training. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
His trainers were wary and consulted his uncle about whether to take him to the Healing Coven. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
His uncle declared them minor injuries and Hunter was ordered to pick himself up and carry on with the training exercise, which he did without question. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: n,}
Three broken fingers and a shattered tibia when he graduated from hand-to-hand and started training with non-magical wooden bo-staffs. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The healer in the castle Infirmary snapped at his trainer that no child of four should be put through rigmarole like that. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: n,}
She was told just to shut up and repair him so he could grip the staff and take a ready stance again as soon as possible. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He never saw that healer again and lost track of the date in the endless training regimen that followed. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Two broken kneecaps and a serious concussion after falling from an artificial magic staff while learning to fly over the castle courtyard. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He zoned in and out during that healing and vaguely heard some witch talking about pre-pubescent bones being more resilient. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He didn't recall bouncing much when he hit the cobblestones but adults knew more about that sort of thing than him so he accepted the explanation for why he wasn't dead. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Detached thumb and a dislocated elbow when his uncle accidentally threw him into the path of a door that was closing. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
That was unusual. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Typically, his uncle waited for the door to be fully closed before lashing out. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: n,}
Then again, his uncle was clearly having a particularly awful day so it only made sense that Hunter was in the way. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
The heavy wood of the door severed his thumb at the joint. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
If his grip on his staff had not been essential to his effectiveness in combat, his uncle assured him he would have been left to sew it back on himself as punishment. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
Darius of the Abomination Coven commented that even children Hunter's age could use lessons in sewing and other useful skills but did not volunteer himself as a new tutor in Hunter's training schedule. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Four cracked ribs and slashed palms caused by a rough landing after being pushed out of an airship and told not to die. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
All things considered, after grabbing and hitting so many tree branches on the way down, he was surprised more hadn't broken. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He supposed the injuries were so minor that no healer would be called and he would be expected to let his body heal naturally this time. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: n,}
That happened a lot if things weren't serious enough, or his uncle wanted to teach him a lesson about not showing weakness in front of others. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
He lay on the ground beneath the tree that broke his fall for far too long though. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
When he was found by something small, orange and furry that sniffed at his hair and howled to mark the discovery, he was suffering from exposure. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He was dimly aware of being whisked to someone from the Healing Coven who murmured about him only just entering double digits but it was hard to remember afterwards. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Hypothermia and abdominal lacerations from being left on a mountain and told to find his own way down. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The other Emperor's Coven recruits in their identity-smothering masks were all twelve so he assumed he must be too. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He met a snow beast halfway with far too many teeth. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
By the time he reached the bottom his own blood had frozen to his front where the thing tried to claw his guts out. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
His uncle actually patted his shoulder that time, which Hunter took to mean he was proud before he passed out. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
Skull fractures and a thigh bone snapped in so many places he was laid up for a week even with healing spells. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He had been trying to prove his worth over the other Scouts on a wild witch hunt and been taken unawares by their target's wild magic. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The blast pushed him off the edge of a cliff. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He didn't know how long he lay with his leg at an impossible angle, pieces of sharp rock jutting up through the muscle, each surrounded by splintered bone fragments. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He faded in and out of consciousness from pain and blood loss. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He thought maybe his uncle found him but that could have been a delusion. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Certainly, someone encased his leg to prevent him from bleeding out, picked him up and carried him back to the castle, muttering about little princes thinking they were immortal and thirteen being an unlucky age. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Deep cuts to both arms and shoulders while tackling a spidren that caught his uncle's caravan unawares during a visit to one of the more far-flung parts of the Isles. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The poison sank deep, rendering him delusional after he stabbed it to death so hard it broken apart at the thorax. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He dreamt his uncle visited him in the Infirmary, mopped his brow with a damp cloth to bring down his fever and whispered about him not being allowed to die and waste the fourteen years of hard work that had been put into him. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
When he woke up weeks later, he had lost so much weight his clothes didn't fit right and the castle seamstresses had to resize everything. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He requested longer sleeves to cover the new scars when his uncle wasn't impressed by them. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
A broken clavicle from being tripped down the stairs. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
In the litany of injuries throughout his life, that was the one that actually embarrassed him. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He was almost sure Kikimora was responsible – he was too surefooted to have just fallen like everyone said and she had laughed harder than anyone when he limped away to answer his uncle's summons despite the radiating pain across his shoulders. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
Third degree burns that covered his hands up to the wrists from a fight with a wild witch who grabbed his arms and plunged them into her cauldron when he tried to apprehend her. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He had screamed that time, something in the mixture corroding through leather gloves and flesh until bone shone through at his knuckles, white as polished narwhalithan horn. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
His team took her down while he was forced to watch, arms buried deep in a snowdrift, hoping the cold would stop the damage before he lost both hands and everything else he had worked so hard for. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Terra Snapdragon had marched up and told him to stop crying like a new-born, he was nearly fifteen, not five. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
She summoned a healer who performed enough triage to save his hands but stopped them before they could completely erase the scars, claiming he needed a permanent reminder not to act like a child while on duty. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
Remembering his uncle's disapproval last time, Hunter started wearing his gloves every moment he was awake, even when he was alone, too ashamed to look at the evidence of his past failure. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
A chunk of his ear was snipped off by a juvenile karkinos trying to protect its mother from his team when his uncle needed fresh claw meat. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Hunter did not ask why. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He never asked why. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: y,}
He used to, when he was young and stupid. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
Well, younger and more stupid. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
Now he knew better. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: y,}
Asking why got you worse than a permanent nick in your ear that ached when the weather got damp. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
Perforated gut from being run through by a unicorn his uncle dispatched him to capture so its horn could be harvested. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Unicorns were carnivorous so he took a team of trustworthy guards to coordinate the capture. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
However, Steve got cornered and Hunter found himself pushing the idiot out of the charging unicorn's path before he could think better of it. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Luckily, lugging around a vision-obscuring, struggling body that was stabbing at it with a knife distracted the unicorn long enough for the others to subdue it. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Hunter never quite forgot the sensation of someone holding his arms back while its horn was dragged backwards through his abdomen, nor of Steve tucking a length of intestine back in like he hoped nobody would notice. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Triage healing got him back to the castle where Darius watched him be carried by on a stretcher and shook his head with one hard raised to conceal his expression – presumably disgust at Hunter's failure. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
His uncle was certainly disgusted at the display of incompetent compassion and promised that even fifteen years of time investment was not worth a thing if Hunter could not prove he was worth the effort. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
Deep scores across his spine and back from thowing himself in front of Lillith Clawthorne when she wasn't aware a chamrosh she thought dead was very much still alive. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He pretended his cloak had absorbed most of the attack and marched back to the castle at the head of the crew dragging the beast's corpse, mocking her for her incompetence. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Only when he got back to his room did he release the pained groan he had wanted to let out for hours and curse himself for his own incompetence. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: n,}
His uncle had warned him against ludicrous displays of compassion already. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He resolved to tell no-one of the injury and settled for stealing healing salves out of the Infirmary when no-one was looking and rubbing them awkwardly on his back alone. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
A slash to the face and neck when he tried to help his uncle during a particularly bad attack from his affliction. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Hunter barely got the door to the throne room closed before Belos's arms melted into writhing, contorting masses of blue-green sludge. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
So much pained gurgling ripped from his uncle's throat that Hunter genuinely thought this was it, the big one, the moment he feared most: when the affliction would claim the life of the last of his family and leave him alone in the world. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Hunter advanced, a palisman at the ready, only to be knocked back so forcefully by Belos's flailing limbs that he skidded across the floor and crashed into a table. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
It took him a moment to realise his throat had been gouged out, flesh ripped vertically from his pectoral up to his cheekbone, exposing all the subcutaneous fat, webwork of veins and trembling muscles beneath. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Blood surged up between his fingers as he tried to hold the wound closed and failed, vision dimming with each passing second. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Death was almost a surprise with the swiftness of its arrival. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Then his uncle was there, pressing a piece of paper with a drawing on it against his skin. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
It glowing soft blue, like a healing spell, and suddenly Hunter could breathe again. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The blood stopped flowing, though his hands were stained so red he knew he had not imagined the whole thing. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
His uncle had apologised – apologised! {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
To him! {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: y,}
As if there was anything to apologise for! {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
He had gotten in the way, of course. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
He had failed in his duty of care. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
It was his own stupid fault he had gotten hurt. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
Yet Belos had held Hunter close regardless, an embrace so unprecedented that Hunter was too stunned to question it, and murmured about a promise he had made to never go that route again, especially since Hunter had not betrayed him yet, which confused Hunter but then again confusion was to be expected after so much blood loss. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
Darius came to visit him in the Infirmary afterwards, though he didn't say much. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He stood inside the doorway, brows pulled down in a judgmental frown, and Hunter couldn't help but feel he had failed some unspoken test for him as well as Belos. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: y,}
Yet Darius would not explain and left soon after, saying Hunter wore his new scars well for a kid his age. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Hunter didn't really understand what he meant by that. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
His uncle had insisted on the healer witches leaving his face scarred as a ‘reminder', though whether for Hunter or himself was unclear. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Hunter assumed it was to remind him not to get in the way in future. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
A bruised coccyx when he landed after an airship crash caused by that ridiculous human who thought she could learn magic. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
To be fair, she might have healed him a little when he was asleep, before she slapped him awake and left a handprint over his scarred cheek. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
It was the kind of stupidly kind thing she would do for an enemy. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Kikimora added a later head wound from an uncontrolled magical blast that would have caved in his entire skull if she had been a fraction of an inch to the left. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He took grim satisfaction in slamming the little red demon's head with his staff while she was too disoriented to know he was there. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Things … changed after that. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Flapjack, forever tucked safely into his cloak, made Hunter more aware of possible injuries. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He took more care to avoid them in case the little bird got cracked or worse. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He didn't care for himself – his purpose was to serve the Emperor even at the cost of his life, after all – but Flapjack had no such allegiance and did not deserve to suffer for Hunter's incompetence or failures. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
That stupid human girl worked her way into his life and no matter how much he pushed her away, she somehow kept coming back. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
She was like a direwolf with a bone; completely unable to be dissuaded once she had made the decision to befriend him. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
With her came others, trailing like thorny vines that hooked into his clothes and skin, growing back no matter how often he tried to pull them out: Captain Willow who gave him a chance he didn't have to earn first; Gus the Prodigy Illusionist who talked a big talk despite his diminutive statue; the youngest Blight and the cursed Owl Lady; Viney and her stupid griffin that never learned to like him; Skara, who played soothing music when he was stressed and sent him the files over Penstagram. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Did he have … friends? {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Allies? {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Or were they more opportunists like the Coven Heads and castle workforce? {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: y,}
Would any of them push him out of an airship, strand him on a mountain or send him sprawling down a flight of stairs if he angered them? {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
Cuts and scrapes to his face and neck from his madcap run through the woods after he and Luz escaped from his uncle's – no, EmperorBelosPhillip's – mind. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He tumbled down an embankment in his haste to get away from her, the Owl Lady, the pets they kept and the knowledge they had uncovered. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He wasn't real. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He was just a copy of someone else, someone more important whom Belos had killed regardless. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
When he reached the bottom, he tucked himself inside a hollow rotten log and stayed there until dawn, too stupefied to move. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Flapjack found him but did not twitter out his location to his enemies – Allies? {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Friends? {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
– instead hopping into the log too and bedding down in Hunter's hair like the weight of his small body could ground him somehow. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Ridiculously, it worked. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Guards were looking for him in the morning, so he fled to the only place he had ever felt truly safe and accepted. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
When Gus discovered him hiding at the school, Hunter had not showered in weeks. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
His ablutions had to take place when the student bathrooms were unoccupied and the showering facilities were locked at night when the school was closed. {physical_violence: , emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He knew he stank worse than griffin dung but realistically there was nothing he could do about it. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Hygiene had to take a back seat to survival while he was on the run. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Why else would he have stooped to eating literal garbage? {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Some Golden Guard. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Some perfect pupil. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Some ideal nephew. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
So when he was finally able to stop hiding, when Gus offered him a place to stay that was not a closed off auditorium or a hollow log in the woods, Hunter cautiously accepted it, wondering all the while what the catch was. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Gus's house was ordinary in a way Hunter could not fully accept was not a trick. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He made sure to bolt the bathroom door when encouraged to go inside and wash up for the first time that month. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The water ran brown and grey and red, bits of soil and filth clagging the plughole until he picked them out with a finger. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He stared at his hands under the warm spray from the showerhead, noting the new blisters and calluses from learning how to handle Flapjack's staff instead of the fake one given to him by his uncle – the Emperor, Belos, Phillip Wittebane, an almost-stranger, not his family. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He turned his face up into the water, coughing when it flowed into his airway for a second. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The cough jolted loose his thoughts and galvanised him back to the business of washing. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He lathered up his hair with something that smelled of flowers he could not name, washed the fresh cuts from the fight at the school so they would not get infected and allowed a tiny bit of tension to ease from his shoulders. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
That tension returned when he walked into the bedroom to find Gus depositing a pile of folded clothes on the bed. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
They had been for him to find once he finished in the shower. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Gus had clearly intended to be gone by the time that happened but Hunter had not allowed himself as much time for cleanliness as his – new best friend? {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
– ally had anticipated. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
They stared at each other with wide eyes, Gus holding a balled-up pair of blue socks, Hunter with one hand on the doorframe, one holding the towel wrapped around his waist. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Gus turned away first. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Hunter cinched the towel tighter and strode into the bedroom like nothing was wrong. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He had long since learned that if you pretended everything was fine with enough confidence, everyone around you tended to believe it too and left you alone. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Gus clearly had not learned that same lesson. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He edged out of the room, muttering about his dad's shirt fitting Hunter better than his own owing to the differences in their height and how he was making food downstairs. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Hunter let him get as far as the hallway before saying thank you and letting Flapjack nudge it closed. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Only then did he sit on the bed and try to get his breathing under control, faithfully counting on his fingers until the dull ache in his ribs alleviated. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He knew about his scars. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
They were the evidence of his failures. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
They did not bother him anymore except as a reminder of those times he had screwed up. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Seeing Gus's expression, though, the way his gaze ticked to the various purple marks of previous times he had been hurt for his disappointing performance, reminded Hunter why he kept them covered. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
However, there had been something else in Gus's gaze; something Hunter had rarely seen before and almost never aimed at himself: sympathy. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
Gus felt sorry for him. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
But why? {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
It did not make any sense. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
They were square. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
More than square. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
A sandwich for a favour for a rescue for a friendship for a place to stay for a …
Luz's voice echoed in his head that friendship was not about that sort of give and take, which was stupid because he knew she had never actually said that to him so how could he be remembering her saying it? {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He put on the borrowed clothing, spent a few moments centring himself by stroking Flapjack's soft chest feathers, then went downstairs to where Gus was making food in the kitchen and pretending everything was fine. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Hunter was content with that. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He made himself useful helping with preparations and answering questions he had not already covered when interrogated by the school faculty about the Day of Unity. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Gus's father had already gone to the Head in advance. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Gus was worried since he would be out of contact until after the celebration. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Hunter wondered what that felt like. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He had been concerned about Belos's safety when they were outside the castle but he wasn't sure ‘worry' was the right word for it. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He had felt dutybound to protect his only family, to please him, care for him, make sure he wasn't in pain from his affliction. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Was that worry? {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Was that love? {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
It was all very confusing. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Gus paused with an apple slice halfway to his mouth and reminded Hunter to breathe. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
It made Hunter's ear tips glow with furious blushing. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
To be reminded like that by someone who had not even graduated high school yet! {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He was the Golden Guard! {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He knew how to breathe. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
So why, then, did his chest feel so tight despite the loose-fitting shirt? {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Why did his throat ache? {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Why was it so hard to talk? {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Gus did not ask about the scars. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Hunter was not sure whether he wanted him to stay silent or not. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He was even less sure when, days later, they met up with Willow to escort Luz on her mission. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
There were moments Gus and Willow had whispered side conversations and more than once he saw Gus gesturing to a spot on his body where Hunter knew the worst of his old injuries showed on his own and Willow would look over at him. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Her skills of subterfuge were exactly zero. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
She would make an awful spy. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The aching sympathy in her eyes was impossible to mistake. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
She was cactus-sharp and diamond-hard but her eyes were always so damn soft with emotion. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He was glad when Luz was dropped into the clearing in front of them and they had something else to focus on other than him and his weaknesses. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He was half-convinced the draining spell would leave new scars on his arms, chest, neck and face but the golden glow faded along with the pain when the Collector moved the moon – he moved the whole moon, sweet merciful mother of Titans. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
When they landed in the Human Realm the rain did not scour his skin like those times in training when he had to run across the courtyard in a storm to build up his pain threshold. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
His feet hurt as they walked from the rickety wooden shack to Luz's house, Gus carried in a piggyback because he was crying too much to stand, but it was nothing like standing on hot coals during endurance training. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Hunter knew these were hurts he could manage; injuries he would withstand easier than any of the other kids – his allies, no, his friends, real friends, friends he never asked for but now would die for if necessary. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
They would not judge him for his failures, he realised during that brief trip through the rain. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
They would feel sympathy for his much they must have hurt but they would not judge him for her how he got them. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
They would not think him weak, or a fool, or a failure. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
When Camila Noceda asked them all to change into dry clothes that she and the basilisk who lived with her had fetched, Hunter did not hesitate. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He heard the faint gasps and a soft slap as Amity covered her own mouth at the sight of his chest, lean with muscle but lined with so much scar tissue it was hard to tell where one old injury ended and another began. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Luz stared, because of course she did. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He had known she would. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
And, thankfully, there was no sympathy in her eyes, just a kind of anger that wasn't directed at him, but for him. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Luz knew without him having to tell her that his scars came from his life with Belos, who had viewed him as nothing but a tool, not a person who deserved sympathy or friendship or love. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He made himself vulnerable in a totally new way, in that moment. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
His body told his story better than words could. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
And as he settled into a huddle with this clutch of refugees – friends, damn it – who had come to mean so much to him, Flapjack nestling into his hair, Hunter contemplated that today was as good a day as any to commemorate being born again. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Darling, you're drunk again,"

Schlatt coughed at Quackity before dosing another bottle again. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"I've had a hard day of work again what do you expect cunt?" {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: n,}
Schlatt burped. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Schlatt was hazardously swinging around a stained and battered crate of beer. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The usual ocean of brown always unsettled Quackity despite being constantly submerged in it. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The liquid always glared and stared at him like in those odd portraits. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Watching and judging his every move similar to his also unwilling boyfriend, Jschlatt. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Schlatt's drinking "habit" had swamped the whole country in pathetic and outlandish laws and reforms. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Quackity had to apologise intensely with mumbled Spanish when Schlatt tried to outlaw baked goods or hats in Manburg. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Quackity also always had to bring him back from the 24/7 state demanded bars, practically dress him every morning and take emergency control as president. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The pairing of president and vice president was more imbalanced than you would think. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Quackity grumbled as the thought of hours of a dangerous and delirious Schlatt haunted him. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He couldn't really deal with this from dealing with the invasion of the bakery nearby. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"You're being super fucking quiet, any reason?" {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: n,}
Schlatt asked. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Quackity whipped his head away as he glared out the window. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He awkwardly tapped his nail against the wooden table. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The scratching and panted breaths reminded him of how close he was to death. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Trying to forget, he swamped down his spit on his drying throat. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The vice president tried to focus on the birds before his boyfriend screamed. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Schlatt slammed his crate onto the creaking table. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He bellowed a deep grunt before throwing Quackity out of his chair. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Schlatt took in his scent before punching him against the wall. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"You're meant to fucking respect me in this house, okay?" {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: n,}
Schlatt yelled. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Quackity nodded aggressively before his chin was pulled. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"You don't respond like some L'manburgian pussy alright?" {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Schlatt smiled sickly. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The sinister prickles of beard swayed in an act of war. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
A single needle prick of his chubby fingers or his yellowing teeth would kill Quackity. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The man was frozen but at the same time quivering as in a cold storm. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: n,}
Schlatt smushed himself against his boyfriend before sloppily kissing him. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"You always had such nice skin baby querida," Schlatt groaned. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Quackity moved his face to the other side. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He was quicky pulled back to Schlatt as Quackity panted his last breaths out. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Schlatt slowly fumbled with his clothes before Quackity grimaced. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He shoved the president away with a final shaking push. {physical_violence: y,n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Schlatt simply slumbered his undeveloped mouth in shock. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Quackity backed himself up into a corner before running to the kitchen counter. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Quackity picked up a slightly empty bottle of liquor. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He turned to Schlatt who awkwardly ran towards him. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Quackity smashed the bottle into his face. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Schlatt plummeted to the floor as Quackity slammed the whole crate into his face. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Pieces of glass flew everywhere as they landed in his stained and red face. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Quackity dug large pieces with shivering fingers into his dented skin. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Curved unique glass into circles and etched flags across his nose. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Personally carved out each individual strand of his across his claustrophobic beard. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Schlatt was soon unrecognisable as Quackity continued to torture the president. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The president flailed his hands around before being hit away. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The hiccups accompanied with cackles from Quackity scared him too much. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The almost sadistic smile carved into his face unnaturally as he tore him apart. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The artistic and delicate pursuit of creating a new man in the already decaying body. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Desperate and republish grabs at his body similar to nights before. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The vice president seemed entertained like an innocent child at the crime scene. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Soon enough, something awoke inside Quackity. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He remembered he couldn't just get away with such an act. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Not at least without some sort of planning like Schlatt forced him to do. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
With a simple hum, his tremors fled from his body. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Schlatt was quickly chopped up into smaller pieces and shoved inside the same crate. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
A larger and recognisable bottle for the heart, a broken one for his already ruined brain and thin ones for his fingers. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Quackity was giddy at being able to cut up his past co-worker and boyfriend. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Quackity continued until the light of day warned him what came by. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Finally, Quackity shoved the body in the fridge as he disposed of the lying around beer bottles. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The house was now uncluttered and free of any stains Schlatt left in his time. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Quackity was allowed to have his time now. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Away from the sticky and draining monster that inhabited the disgusting form of Schlatt. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
A creature which stole with his greedy fingers, betrayed with his uneven and lying mouth and abuse which travelled across his trapping beard. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: n,}
A man dressed in deceiving white, truthful black and conniving brown was now gone. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Quackity was able to dance and sing away from the man who once abused him. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
All he got was a taste of his spite and black he shot back into the world. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He simply just injected it through something he loved. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
That drinking habit Quackity always hated. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The night is empty in Privet Drive, England. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Not even the summer breeze dares to rustle the leaves on perfectly groomed trees and perfectly cut bushes. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
No birds chirp and no crickets sing, even the creatures of the night stay silent as they hide. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
For the summer breeze turns cold. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
And the night is kissed by death. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Harry Potter is known for being the boy who lived, escaping death when no one else managed to be able to. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Voldemort, he who must not be named, the Dark Lord, death. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
And he managed to escape as an infant. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
A streak of luck some could say. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Some could say he used all his luck in that very moment. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
For if there is ever going to be another title bestowed upon the boy it would be: Harry Potter, the boy with the worst luck in the Wizarding World. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Because if that weren't the case then he wouldn't currently be fighting for his continuation at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
And by a strobe of luck that wasn't his own, borrowed shortly for a time, he manages to earn his place back in his home. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
But that is only part of the story, in order for everything to fall into place, one has to start at the beginning. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The summer after Cedric's death was arguably the worst Harry's experienced yet. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
It started out calm, quiet, a normality he was used to. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He'd rather be neglected than noticed by the Dursleys. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: n,}
Being noticed means being hurt. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: n,}
Sure it started out fine, but with a cousin easily bored and an aunt and uncle who would do anything for their son, he was noticed. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: n,}
And he'd rather anything than be noticed. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
It wasn't like it was anything worse than it had in past years, just that Dudley is now developing a sense of muscle and Vernon and Petunia are becoming even crueler with age, so yeah, not really all that different. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: n,}
He sucks in a breath as he nurses the split skin on his chin, careful not to press too hard on the Dudley fist sized bruise surrounding it. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Not different at all. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Callused fingers trail across the injured skin, he squints into the small handheld mirror Hermione had bought for him as a joke a year back as a "congratulations for figuring out the Egg idiot, maybe now you can see how stupid you are for entering the Competion" gift. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He frowns at the hollow shape his cheeks are beginning to form and slips his glasses back on. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He flops backwards onto his pillow, turning to glare at Hedwig's empty cage. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Said absent owl currently stretching her wings above the many homes of England. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He sighs, resting his arm over his eyes, blocking out the blinding light of the mid-morning sun. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
This is the time of day where Harry feels like he's floating, he's not needed, he just exists. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He likes the feeling of being allowed to just exist. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He's already made breakfast and he finished dusting everything the day prior, he'll need to vacuum after lunch, but lunch isn't until a few hours. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
So he lets himself exist. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
A loud crash sounds in the room next to his. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Dudley and his friends' boisterous laughter brings him back down to reality. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Harry!" {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He wishes he didn't exist. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
Taking a deep steadying breath he grumbles to himself, plopping his feet onto his bedroom floor and making his way to a waiting Uncle Vernon. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Voice pinched he greets him. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Yes sir?" {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"What have I told you about using magic in this home!" {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Vernon's face is red to the ears and Harry fights off a laugh at how stupid Vernon looks when he's angry. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"My wand is currently locked away in the cupboard, sir." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
His voice drips with sarcasm, a brief feeling of satisfaction pumps through him at Vernon's dumbfounded expression. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
It is, however, quickly slapped away by Vernon's large hand. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Harry blinks, mouthing a small ‘ow' as Vernon shakes with anger. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Vernon grabs onto the back of Harry's hair, forcing him to look at him. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Don't you dare speak to me that way, boy." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: n,}
Harry stares at him, expression unimpressed. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"The crash came from Dudley's room, not mine." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Vernon's hot breath smells of grease as he leans in close. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Then clean it up." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Harry runs back up the stairs as soon as Vernon releases him, laughing to himself at how Vernon's thin hair shook in his rage. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He briefly glances into his room to see if Hedwig had returned, frowning when he sees the still empty cage. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He frowns even harder when he stops in front of Dudley's closed door. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The sounds of the other boys inside churning his stomach ill. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He places three quick raps on the door, rocking on his heel as he waits for it to open. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Who is it?" {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He hears one of the boys, the smaller one, ask. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Probably my stupid cousin here to pick up your mess." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"What is he your maid?" {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
That one came from the taller, meaner one. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Of course the queer's a maid, look at him, he probably gets off on it." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
The smaller one again, really now that he thinks about it, he should really learn their names. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The door opens, revealing Dudley's ugly face. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"What do you want?" {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
It's harsh, but Harry merely brushes it off, peeking around his cousin to see the mess. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
A broken lamp. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Harry sighs. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"To pick up your mess darling cousin." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He mocks the way Petunia speaks, glaring at Dudley with the most blank expression imaginable. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Yeah darling." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The smaller one mocks, laughing ugly as Dudley flicks him off, opening the door with a grumble and letting Harry in. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Shut the fuck up Aiden." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Well, that's a dumb name, at least Harry knows it now. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Aiden laughs, flicking off Dudley in retaliation. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Harry maneuvers around them, crouching down in front of the broken lamp. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Of fucking course it's glass. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He stands, grabbing a tissue off of Dudley's side table, spreading it out in his hand as he begins the pick of the shards of colorful glass. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
From the looks of it the lamp shards it must have been expensive, he grimaces as he places the overpriced trash into the tissue. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
A heavy thunk clashes against the back of Harry's head, he barks a yelp of surprise and pain as the object collides into him. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
In the shock he accidentally slices his palm open with a shard. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Shit." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Hurry up faggot. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
You're killing our vibe." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Aiden gripes as the shoe he threw bounces onto the floor next to Harry. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Harry hisses, gripping his hand tight, dark blood pooling in his palm, staining the colorful glass red. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He stands, rushing to grab another tissue so he doesn't stain the white carpet. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The taller one yawns, unfazed by Harry's rush. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Do we even know that he's gay? {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
I mean he doesn't look it." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Jesus Malik, of course he is. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He's practically moaning that bloke's Cedric's name every night." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Dudley snorts a laugh. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Cedric , oh Cedric." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Harry freezes, brief moments of memories he wishes he'd forget flashing through his mind. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: }
Cedric in the maze. {physical_violence: n,n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The cup. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Cedric dead. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Voldemort. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Cedric dead. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Oh look! {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Seems like you've hit a nerve Duds." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Harry's breathing picks up slightly, not even processing Aiden's cruel words. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He rushes to finish cleaning, dumping the shards in the trash before trying to make his way out of the room. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Oi! {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Queer! {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Don't you dare jerk off to me tonight you got it!?" {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Harry flicks Aiden off as he shuts the door behind him. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Turning into his own room, slamming his own door. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}

Chapter Text
Draco Malfoy is a boy submerged in loneliness, always has been. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
From the moment he was born he was taken from the rest and raised to be the perfect son, the perfect Slytherin, the perfect Malfoy. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
All of which he isn't, all of which he's never been. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Sure in front of his family he puts on the act they give him, playing his part without fail, but when he is without their influence he becomes something they would never let hold their name. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
Maybe in his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry he acted the way he was raised, but he soon learned just how wrong the things he was taught were. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He became educated but careful, he refused to call people "Mudbloods" but he still couldn't be caught kind so he put on his ‘bully' act and that seemed to do the trick. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He does hate it however, throat tightening every cruel word, tears prickling every cruel action. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He hates it. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He hates this. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
So if the price he pays for his unwanted actions is this then he is fine with it. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He'd rather be lonely than be the person he forces himself to be. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Playing with the feathers of his quill he watches the sun set, dinner is soon. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He dips the quill into his overpriced ink, made from the bones of some far away animal, he doesn't care where it came from as long as it writes well, which it doesn't. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He sighs in frustration, wiping the excess ink back into the bottle before it drips onto his letter. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
In big loopy handwriting, very much different from his own neat style, he writes out words he'd get murdered for if his family ever found. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Well, maybe not his mother. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He writes down words he has overheard, things he has seen, experiences one can only witness if what the Boy who Lived says is true. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
And they are. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He who must not be named has returned. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
And he is in Draco's very own home. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The screams of the muggle woman below are enough to fortify his knowing. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
For a brief moment he wonders if the Muffliato charm could work both ways. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He flinches slightly as the woman sobs for help, only to be interrupted by another set of shrieks. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He dips the quill in ink again, trying hard to focus on what his father is asking the woman between each unforgivable. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He blinks heavily in order to push away the tears pooling in his eyes. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
I'm trying. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Hours later his mother comes to greet him. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Draco darling?" {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
She knocks on his door, harsh body language going kind as she waits for her son. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
When he opens his door his face is red and eyes are puffy, Narcissia frowns, worry creasing her brow. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
She wants to check in on him, make sure he's ok, but she knows she can't, they are wanted. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
So instead she just whispers a small spell as he walks past, clearing his face from all signs of previous distress. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
For there shall be no delays when you are called by the Dark Lord. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
She walks behind him, both their hands firmly grasped behind their backs, a behavior taught young. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
A sign of obedience. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
She watches as his carefully manicured hand taps nervously against his wrist, squinting slightly at left-over residue of scrubbed away ink. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Narcissa Malfoy straightens, posture going rigid and face turning mean, empty. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
She watches her son's do the same. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
And together like mice they enter where the snakes lay in wait. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Draco takes his place next to his father with his head held high, knuckles white. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
His father and the rest of the Deatheaters are already lined, faces flushed with excitement as they wait for their Lord. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The door creaks open and a long snake, with a terrifyingly human expression, makes its way into the room, slithering between people, wrinkling perfectly straightened robes, it wraps around Draco's ankles before returning to its master's waiting hand. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Draco breathes, he hates that snake. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The Dark Lord smiles as he looks upon his followers, taking in their eager body language with interest. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
His gaze stops on Draco, Draco stills. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"He does not bear the mark Lucius." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The Dark Lord speaks, not taking his eyes off the boy. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"No my Lord, but he must begin to learn how to serve you for when he is needed." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Draco looks at his father, bowing submissively, it's a strange sight to see, such a cruel man so willingly following another. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The Dark Lord hums in thought, humoring the idea in his mind. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"For when he is needed then." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
And he turns away, leading the rest into the room where the screams come loudest. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The Dark Lord takes his seat at the head of the table, long fingers intertwining as he watches the rest of them take their own seat. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Draco goes to sit between his mother and father when the Dark Lord holds up a hand stopping him. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"You're here to learn are you not?" {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Draco hesitantly nods, wanting nothing more than to leave. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The Dark Lord smiles and gestures to the empty seat next to him. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Come sit with me, my child." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Draco makes brief eye contact with his mother, searching for reassurance in her cold gaze. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Upon not finding any he swallows dryly, pushing his chair in as he makes his way to the front of the table, sitting down quietly, hands gripping the edges of his seat tightly. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Three of the Malfoy house elves make their way around the room, fearfully reaching around the Deatheaters in order to place plates and drinks. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Draco prays that the Dark Lord didn't notice how he leaned back out of habit in order to make the elves' (a kind older elf called Kit) job easier, or how Kit's ears dropped slightly when Draco's usual thankful smile was not given. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The Dark Lord, however, was watching, and he did notice. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
A small smile spread upon his snakelike face, Nagini curling up at his feet. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Draco holds his breath as her weight presses against the side of his foot. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The Dark Lord notices this as well. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Draco waits for the Dark Lord to begin to eat before he even dared touch his utensils, cutting the fish with careful precision, focusing all his nervous energy into the motion. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The Dark Lord's smile grows larger as he watches. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Draco was barely three bites in before the Dark Lord raises his hand once more. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Everyone stills, sounds of utensils being dropped the only in the room. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Draco watches the Dark Lord's hand lower as he hesitantly finishes chewing. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"I do feel it is time for our promised entertainment, is it not Lucius?" {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Draco watches his father stand with a bow and leave, confusion coursing through his veins, when his father returns his heart stops dead. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Behind his father floats the muggle woman from hours earlier. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Her screams echo in his mind, he feels himself go pale. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Hoots and hollers come from the adults around him, slurs being thrown about as the muggle woman comes to a stop and floats above the table. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
She makes eye contact with Draco, confusion obvious as to why someone as young as him is here, his eyes jerk away sharply as tears drip from her own as she mouths a weak ‘help'. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
His finger taps against his seat in order to try and compose himself, he knows the Dark Lord is watching his reaction. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Draco." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The Dark Lord drawls, smiling cruelly at his frightened reaction. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
"You are here to learn?" {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Draco swallows. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Yes my Lord." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Then watch." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Draco's throat tightens as the snakelike man pulls out a long wand, holding it lightly in his pale fingers. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He points it at the muggle woman. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Do you know who this is my child?" {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Draco and the woman make eye contact again, she only stares at him. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"No my Lord." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
A hand rests on his shoulders. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Do you know what she is?" {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"She's a filthy muggle." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He forces as much disgust into his voice as possible, hating the way it sounds, hating the way the woman broke eye contact, hope leaving her face entirely. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The hand shifts, tightening around the back of his neck, long sharp nails pinching into his skin. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"And what do we do with filthy muggles?" {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Draco's mouth dries as his eyes begin to water. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"We kill them." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The Dark Lord hums happily, lifting his wand to point at the woman, upon seeing it she sobs, hopelessly begging for help. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Crucio." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Her head tips backwards, a loud painful scream ripping itself from her throat, arms and legs shaking as she writhes in the air. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
She shrieks and shrieks and shrieks, head twisting from side to side as she convulses. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Spit and blood dribbles off the side of her face, splattering the table below. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Draco watches it fall, heart in his throat and his stomach simultaneously, his face red with anger and fear. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He wants to stop it, please stop, please stop. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Stop! {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Please stop it! {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The woman screams louder with the twist of the Dark Lord's hand, her chest rising as she struggles to breathe. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Please! {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Her eyes roll back into her head. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Stop! {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He chokes, twisting his head out of the Dark Lords hold, tears betray him as they stream down his face hot and heavy. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The woman's screaming stops. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Everything stops. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The snake at his feet coils tightly around his ankle. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Draco's stomach drops. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Ever so slowly he looks back at the Dark Lord. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The Dark Lord is not looking at him back. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He follows his gaze to his father's blank face. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
His father looks from the Dark Lord to Draco, standing with a bow, knuckles white, obviously containing his anger. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Draco shrinks into his seat. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"My Lord I-" his father begins, the Dark Lord holds up a hand silencing him. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"I believe that you said he is here to learn?" {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Draco's father's eyes bare into his own. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"He is, My Lord." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Draco's hands scrunch into fists. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Then care to explain to me why he refuses too?" {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"I'm afraid I do not know My Lord, but I assure you he will receive punishment for disobeying you." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The Dark Lord hums, long pale fingers tapping the table. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"I do believe there is a way your son may redeem himself." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
A hand wraps around Draco's wrist, prying it upward. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The Dark Lord twists Draco's arm to where Draco has to face him completely. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Do you have your wand my child?" {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Draco nods. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Yes, my Lord." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
His arm is let go and he pulls the wand from his coat pocket, fingers shaking slightly. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Upon this the Dark Lord once again grabs onto Draco's wrist, only now angling it to point at the muggle woman. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Upon seeing her Draco wonders if she's dead, the ever so slight rise and fall of her chest argue otherwise. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The fingers around his wrist tighten, hot breath on his ear. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The command is a hiss. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Kill her." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Draco's pulse rings in his ears, his head jerking to face the snake-like man next to him. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
A malicious smile greets him. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"What?" {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He manages, voice shaking. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"I don't like repeating myself, my child." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The Dark Lord yanks Draco's arm into a painful stance, wand pointed sharply at the muggle woman. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Kill her, now." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The tears Draco sheds grow fast now, no longer only pooling in his eyes, dripping down his face, off his chin. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He trembles in the Dark Lord's hold. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"I-" he hiccups "I can't." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The Dark Lord's nails dig into his arm, blood pooling where they break his skin, he pulls out his own wand, digging it into the skin right above Draco's sternum, cutting off his breathing, turning it shallow. {physical_violence: y, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
Draco whimpers with fear. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: y, psychological_violence: y,}
The Dark Lord regards him, thoughts flickering behind his snake like eyes. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He removes the wand and instead points it at the muggle woman, Draco follows the movement with his eyes. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
He wishes he hadn't. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The muggle woman's eyes open. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
The Dark Lord smiles. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
"Avada Kedavra." {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
And the woman falls limp. {physical_violence: n, emotional_violence: n, psychological_violence: n,}
